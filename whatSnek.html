    <h1>What Snek?</h1>
    <p>Well, snek is an internet meme, usually used when describing cute snake photos. I just use it because I thought it'd be funny.</p>
    <h1>What is this "Snake" Game?</h1>
    <p>Snake is a simple video game of which you control a snake like being, navigating through the map to get food, while avoiding the walls and your growing tail.
      Originally popularized by its appearance in old Nokia mobile phones, now it has become a nostalgic game for a lot of people.</p>
    <h1>What did I Learn?</h1>
    <p>I have gotten some experience making a HTML game of my own, and I have gained the confidence that I did it without just copying someone else's codes.
      Though I have also learnt the update delay in HTML games may not be good for faster pace games. And that HTML games are still quite limited, but a lot is still possible.
      And lastly, I learnt that I should not trust a Internet stranger who studies in Computer Science when he says that making snake in HTML is easy.</p>
