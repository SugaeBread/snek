    <h1>Why Snek?</h1>
    <p>The primary reason I am making a snake game is to allow me to learn how to make a HTML game by actually making one.
      The first time I was exposed to the idea of a HTML snake game was through a YouTube channel called CodeBullet. It was also from this that I heard snake is an easy game to make.
      So when it came the time for me to start learning how to make a HTML game, I knew I wanted to make a snake game.</p>

    <h1>Why HTML Game?</h1>
    <p>I am an Unity game developer. But I wanted to find a medium to make games less physics intensive, so that it can be less complex and reach more people. Since basically every computer has a web browser, just building the game into the website is quite obviously a good option for this. And plus, I already have some experience programming games in C#. Might as well transfer some of this knowledge into learning JavaScript. Though you can probably tell I am not too good at this if you look at my codes.</p>
